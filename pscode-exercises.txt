d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

Display numbers 65, 78, 74, 90, and 77

Add the values of 65, 78, 74, 90, and 77 to get value S
Divide S by 5
Display this number as Average

Display the value closest to zero as Minimum
Display the value furthest from zero as Maximum.

Results:
65, 78, 74, 90, and 77
S = 384
Average 76.8
Minimum 65
Maximum 90
